# todo-list
A simple, responsive todo list web application. 

You can use this app here: https://rayls.io/todo/

The application utilizes Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS to be interactive and responsive across all your devices. A cookie is utilized to store the list specific to your device. 

More functionality, such as cross device list storage, may be added as I learn more backend web development.
